# Contribution guidelines

We are all friends here, but let's try and keep this thing civil to avoid destroying each other code!

Ideally:
- Each new feature would be implemented in a new branch feature/<name>;
- Each bug would be solved in a new branch bug/<name>;
- Let's try and use the Pull Requests system to merge to master. Would be nice to have the two not submitting the PR reviewing/accepting the code;
- For each item you are working on, move the Trello Card into the relevant column and assign the task to yourself if applicabile;
